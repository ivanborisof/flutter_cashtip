Customer's Terms of Reference:</br>
«I had a problem in counting tips for large company. I often attend events where this is required and it takes a very long time. I need an app that works quickly and simply does the counting function, because all the percentage calculators are very cumbersome. The design doesn't matter at all, it's up to your taste. I need to make applications before the weekend (3 days).»
